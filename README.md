A Utility Software with Voice Recognition, Do everything you wan't to do...
You can also add commands/statements and make the speech recognition better, but I will not be updating this software or fixing the bugs until the Month of April...

I am 15 years old, Computer enthusiast and like to do stuff... e.g. I have also made a Control Panel(HTML/PHP/JS)(There is also a Windows
version of it), but it was made for my Friends who play SAMP(GTA: San Andreas Multiplayer) and most of it is only for Admins, by the way it is also not an Active Project and is not updated anymore, I have also worked on Scripts used on the SAMP Server(IP:samp.wgaming.net)...

If you like it Share it... ;)
